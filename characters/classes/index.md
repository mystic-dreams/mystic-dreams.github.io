# Classes

## Types
### Wizard/Sorcerer/Archmage

Specialised in single target. Built for bossing. Allows challenging areas that are higher level to compensate for poor mobbing capability.

### Shaman/Warlock/Sage

Specialised in mobbing. Built for farming.

### Disciple/Prophet/Saint

Specialised in survivability. Balance between single and multi-targeting. Lower damage.

## Design Decisions

### Sustainability

As this is a single player game, classes have to be able to hold their own weight. As such, they cannot be too weak to fight a boss.
